# STM32 PWM Configuration Guide

This project contains code that is used to configure and control an STM32 microcontroller for Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) output. The following guide provides a brief overview of the key functions in the provided code and their functionalities.

## Function Descriptions

### 1. `PWM_init_halb_Bridig(void)`

This function is used to initialize the GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) pins on the STM32 for the alternate function of PWM output.

The function uses the STM32Cube Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) library to initialize the GPIO pins, setting their modes, speed, output type, pull-up or pull-down resistors and their alternate function to be used for the PWM signal generation. It uses multiple pins across GPIO Ports A, C, and E, setting their alternate function to be either TIM1 or TIM8, which are hardware timers on the STM32 that can generate PWM signals.

### 2. `Sprungsignal(int i_id, int DutyCycle, int NumberOfPulses)`

This function is used to handle the configuration and control of the timers TIM1, TIM8, and TIM4 for PWM output based on the value of the `i_id` argument.

- If `i_id` is 0, all PWM channels on TIM1 and TIM8 are disabled.
- If `i_id` is 1, 2, or 3, various channels on TIM1 and TIM8 are set up for PWM output, with specific configurations for each value of `i_id`.

Note that the parameters `DutyCycle` and `NumberOfPulses` are declared but not used in the provided part of the function. 

The function uses several HAL functions (like `TIM_TimeBaseInit`, `TIM_OC1Init`, etc.) to configure the timers (including settings for base clock, PWM output, period, prescaler, etc.) and to control the behavior of the PWM output.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this code allows you to configure and control the hardware timers of an STM32 microcontroller to generate PWM signals on multiple output pins. The specific behavior can be controlled by the `i_id` parameter of the `Sprungsignal` function. The actual results will depend on the hardware setup and the specific STM32 model being used.
